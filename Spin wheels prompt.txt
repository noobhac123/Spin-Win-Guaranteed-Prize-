Create a complete Prize Winning Spin Wheel web app using a single HTML file that is fully mobile-friendly and includes all CSS, JavaScript, and animations inside the same file. You may use external CDNs for animations (like confetti).

Use Custom Spin Image:

The spin wheel must use an image file named spin.png, placed in the same folder as the HTML file.

Do not draw the wheel using canvas or SVG — just rotate the image using CSS/JS for the spin effect.

I will add the image file myself. Just make sure the code uses it as spin.png.

Web Page Features & Flow:

1. Modern UI Design

Design the page with a celebration-based, prize-winning theme using glowing gradients, stylish fonts, and animated elements.

Use a heading like:
“Spin the Wheel & Win a Guaranteed Prize!”



2. Spin Wheel Setup

Display the image spin.png at the top center.

Below it, place a glowing “SPIN NOW” button with hover and click animation.



3. Prize Segments (12 Options)
The wheel must visually show 12 prize sections labeled with the following:

₹100 PayTM Cash

Movie Ticket

iPhone 14

Samsung TV

Smartwatch

Bluetooth Speaker

AirPods

Better Luck Next Time

Amazon Voucher ₹50

Free Coffee Coupon

20% Discount Voucher

Surprise Gift Box



4. Winning Logic

Although "Better Luck Next Time" is shown on the wheel, make sure the wheel never lands on it.

Always randomly land on one of the 11 real prizes.



5. Spin Animation

On clicking the SPIN button, rotate the spin.png image with realistic easing and deceleration.

After spinning, determine the prize and stop the wheel accordingly.



6. Winning Message

After the spin ends, display:
“Congratulations! You won [Prize Name]”

Then:
“To claim your prize, share this page with 10 WhatsApp friends.”



7. WhatsApp Share

Add a WhatsApp share button with pre-filled text:
“I just won a real prize on this Spin & Win page! Try your luck too!”

After sharing, simulate return (e.g., after a delay or flag) to show the next step.



8. Prize Claim Form

After sharing, reveal a form with:

Name input

Mobile Number input

Submit button with animation


On submission, display:

“Your prize claim has been submitted successfully!”

“Congratulations again! You will be contacted soon.”




9. Celebration Effects

Use confetti animation when the user wins.

All interactive elements (Spin, Share, Submit) must have glowing outline and hover/click animations.



10. Responsive Design

The entire page should look great on all phones and screen sizes (100% mobile-friendly).



11. Single File Only

All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be in one .html file.

You may use CDN links for external libraries (e.g., for confetti).

Important: Use the image file named spin.png for the wheel and rotate it dynamically. Do not create the wheel in code — just animate the image.
